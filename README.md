# Overview
As a software engineer, my goal is to continue developing my skills in full-stack web development, especially in building dynamic and interactive web applications. This project is part of my learning process, allowing me to apply modern web technologies like React and APIs, improving my ability to build functional and visually appealing applications.

The web app I built is an interactive portfolio designed to showcase the projects and technologies I have worked with. The design focuses on a clean, attractive interface that highlights key projects and provides an overview of my skills as a developer. The app allows users to explore different sections, such as my personal introduction, project gallery, and contact information.

To run the app locally:

1. Install dependencies:

    npm install

2. Start the server:

    npm start


Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.


The purpose of this app is to create a professional portfolio that highlights my work and demonstrates my proficiency with React and web development best practices.

# Web Pages

The web app consists of several pages, each serving a different purpose:

Home Page: The first page users see when they visit the website. It introduces who I am and what I do, with dynamic animations and an interactive layout.
About Page: This page provides more detailed information about my background, skills, and experience. 
Portfolio Page: Displays my projects in a gallery format, dynamically pulling project data from a JSON file or API and rendering it as individual cards. Each project card is clickable and leads to the Github repository of the project.
Contact Page: A contact form that allows users to reach out. The form dynamically handles user input, validation, and submission.
The app transitions between pages using smooth scroll effects, and I use React Router for navigation.

# Development Environment

To develop the web app, I used the following tools:

Text Editor: Visual Studio Code for writing the code.
Package Manager: npm to manage dependencies.
Version Control: Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting.
Deployment: Vercel for deploying the app.
The app was developed using JavaScript (React) as the primary programming language. Libraries and tools include:

React: For building the app's components.
React Router: For handling page transitions and navigation.
CSS (SCSS): For styling the app.
React-icons: For adding vector icons to the interface.
